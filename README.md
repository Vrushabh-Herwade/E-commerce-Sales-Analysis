## 🔍 Objectives

- Analyze delivery delays, shipping times, and customer wait time
- Understand product category trends and return behavior
- Identify top-performing sellers and shipping bottlenecks
- Build a business-ready dashboard for decision-making

## 🧪 Key Steps

### ✅ 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled 100k+ rows across multiple tables
- Merged orders, items, customers, and reviews
- Created new features: `delivery_delay`, `shipping_time`, `customer_wait_time`

### ✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified high-delay categories and states
- Analyzed seller count vs performance
- Visualized return trends across product categories

### ✅ 3. SQL-Based Analysis
- Wrote MySQL queries for:
  - Seller rankings by late deliveries
  - Category-wise delivery KPIs
  - State-wise shipping performance

### ✅ 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Designed 5-page interactive report
- Included KPIs, delay maps, product trends, return rates, and seller performance
- Built custom visuals using DAX and filters
